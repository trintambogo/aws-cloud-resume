## Prerequisites

- An AWS account
- A registered domain name
- Basic understanding of AWS services (S3, CloudFront, Certificate Manager, Route 53)

## Architecture

![webimage](https://github.com/trintambogo/aws-cloud-resume/assets/87088123/20a68cf9-c47b-435a-a90e-ec81aaf9dd2e)

When a user writes your domain name into their browser, Route 53 translates the domain name into the correct IP address and directs the request to the Cloudfront distribution. Cloudfront then quickly retrieves the resume files from the nearest edge location ensuring fast delivery. These files are stored in Amazon s3 securely and are secured over a secure HTTPS connection managed by certificate manager.

## Setup Instructions

## 1. Create an S3 Bucket

1. Go to the S3 service in the AWS Management Console.
2. Click "Create bucket".
3. Enter a unique bucket name and select the appropriate region.
4. Click "Create bucket".

### Upload Resume to S3

1. Open your newly created S3 bucket.
2. Click "Upload" and select your resume files (i.e, `index.html`, `style.css`).

   - Click on "Create Record."
   - **Record Name**: Leave it blank to map the root domain
   - **Record Type**: Select "A â€“ IPv4 address."
   - **Alias**: Turn on the "Alias" toggle.
   -  On the "route traffic to" choose, Select Alias to CloudFront distribution and select the distribution we created earlier.

## 6. Editing S3 Bucket Policy for CloudFront to Access S3 bucket
We need to enable CloudFront to access our S3 bucket and serve content. We therefore need to edit the S3 bucket policy to allow access from the CloudFront origin.

1. **Select Your Distribution**:
   - Click on the ID of the distribution you want to configure and Copy the ID name.
     ![WhatsApp Image 2024-06-27 at 1 11 28 PM](https://github.com/trintambogo/aws-cloud-resume/assets/87088123/97422375-3b3c-4e5c-9f01-f8a91329e1a3)
   - Copy ARN name of the Distribution ID into a notepad

2. **Update Your S3 Bucket Policy**:
- Navigate to S3 
- Click on the name of the bucket you are using as the origin for your CloudFront distribution.
- Go to the "Permissions" tab.
- Under "Bucket policy," click on the "Edit" button.
- Add a new policy that grants the CloudFront OAI access to the bucket. Replace `AWS:SourceArn` with the actual ARN from your CloudFront distribution and `S3 bucket name` with your bucket name.

Here is a sample bucket policy:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": {
        "Sid": "AllowCloudFrontServicePrincipalReadOnly",
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Principal": {
            "Service": "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"
        },
        "Action": "s3:GetObject",
        "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<S3 bucket name>/*",
        "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
                "AWS:SourceArn": "arn:aws:cloudfront::111122223333:distribution/<CloudFront distribution ID>"
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- After adding the policy, click "Save changes."


## Testing and Verification
- Access your resume website via the custom domain to ensure everything is working correctly.
